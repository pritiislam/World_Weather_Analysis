# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
This week's task includes developing a travel application that assists users with finding vacation destinations. Utilizing JSON and API calls, this application compares real-time weather data in thousands of cities around the world, and filters the destination results based on the user's weather specifications (marker map with hotel recommendations). Additionally, there is a built in itinerary planner that maps out directions between the users selected destinations.

## Tools & Resources
* Data Sources: OpenWeatherMap API, Google Maps and Places API
* Python, Jupyter Notebooks
